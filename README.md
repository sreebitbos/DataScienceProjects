# DataScienceProjects - bank customer churn prediction using ML Techniques

In this project on bank customer churn prediction using machine learning, I am trying to explain how a local bank - Hopkinton Credit Union can use predictive analytics to help its marketing staff to identify which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on the improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities. Using the data collected from existing customers, build a model that will help the marketing team identify potential customers who are relatively more likely to churn. Given a Bank customer, we will build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months.
